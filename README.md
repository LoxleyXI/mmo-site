# MMO Site

This site is a simple project to demonstrate skills with React and TypeScript. It calls a [public API](https://github.com/public-apis-dev/public-apis) to provide a list of browser-based MMORPGs, with images and information.

The project makes use of hooks to manage state and effects, with custom components for pagination and cards. It also contains an Express server `npm run server` to handle API calls and bypass CORS issues.


## Setup

* `npm install`
* `npm run server`
* `npm run start`
